It's now posible to generate preview images for social networks ([Twitter](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator), Slack, LinkedIn...).

![twitter card](./twitter-card.png)

This great idea come from a [conversation](https://twitter.com/_maxpou/status/1054106299213012992) I had with Luciano Mammino (aka [@Loige](https://twitter.com/loige)). I basically took 85% of his code. Thanks Luciano ðŸ˜Š


**How to do it?**

1. Open 2 terminals:
  ```bash
  # Terminal 1
  npm run dev

  # Terminal 2
  npm run generatePostPreviewImages
  # ..you can also specify the url (if different from http://localhost:8000/)
  npm run generatePostPreviewImages http://localhost:1234/
  ```
2. In the post's header, add the generated images:
  ```yaml
  title: My blog post
  # ...
  imageShare: ./social-media-card-generator-share.png
  ```

Gatsby will first create extra url suffixed by `/image_share` (i.e. *http://localhost:8000/gatsby-starter-morning-dew-v1-1/image_share*). Then, Pupetter will take a snapshot and add it to your `post` folder.

**ðŸ’¡Quick tip:** If you want to recreate this pictures

```bash
# delete all share images
find ./content -name "*-share.png" -type f -delete
```

If you want to skip the file generation for some posts, add `generate-card: false` to the post's header.

```yaml
---
title: My blog post
# ...
generate-card: false
---
```
