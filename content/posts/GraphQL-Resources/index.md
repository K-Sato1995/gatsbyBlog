# Union Type

A union type is a set of object types that may appear in the same spot.
That means the spot only returns one object, in this case, either `AudioClilp` or `VideoClip`.

```ruby
module Types
  class AudioClipType < Types::BaseObject
    field :id, Int, null: false
    field :duration, Int, null: false
  end
end

module Types
  class MovieClipType < Types::BaseObject
    field :id, Int, null: false
    field :previewURL, String, null: false
    field :resolution, Int, null: false
  end
end

module Types
  class MediaItemType < Types::BaseUnion
    possible_types Types::AudioClipType, Types::MovieClipType

    def self.resolve_type(object, context)
      if object.is_a?(AudioClip)
        Types::AudioClipType
      else
        Types::MovieClipType
      end
    end
  end
end

module Types
  class PostType < Types::BaseObject
    description 'Post'
    field :id, Int, null: false
    field :media_item, Types::MediaItemType, null: true

    def media_item
      return object.audio_clip if object.audio_clip

      object.video_clip
    end
  end
end
```

# Interface

Interfaces are a good choice whenever a set of objects are used interchangeably, and they have several significant fields in common. When they donâ€™t have fields in common, use a Union instead.

```graphql
interface Customer {
  name: String!
  outstandingBalance: Int!
}

type Company implements Customer {
  employees: [Individual!]!
  name: String!
  outstandingBalance: Int!
}

type Individual implements Customer {
  company: Company
  name: String!
  outstandingBalance: Int!
}
```

# Fragments

A GraphQL fragment is a shared piece of query logic.

```
fragment NameParts on Person {
  firstName
  lastName
}

query GetPerson {
  people(id: "7") {
    ...NameParts
    avatar(size: LARGE)
  }
}
```

# Connection_type

Connection will help you paginate through the list of comments connected to the post with 4 default arguments (first, last, after and before) in the query, whereas field here would return a basic list of CommentType.

# Relays

A Facebook page contains several elements and React components, which have different data requirements. GraphQL allows to list all the data we need to generate a page in a single top level query. So we save network from sending multiple requests by querying the data we need in a single round-trip.
